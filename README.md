Automatically add Sigarra Timetables to your Calendar Apps (using *.ics* format and one-click Google Calendar Event)

### Install via:
 - [WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sigarra-to-calendar/piefgbacnljenipiifjopkfifeljjkme)
 - [Add-on for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sigarra-to-calendar/) Thanks a bunch to [@afonsobspinto](https://github.com/afonsobspinto)
 - [Source code](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) in this repo
 - From [.crx](https://github.com/msramalho/SigToCa/blob/master/extra/SigToCa.crx) see how [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Add-Blocked-Extensions-in-Google-Chrome) (not necessarily blocked as the link says)

### Works on:

#### Timetable Extractor
 - Personal schedule
 - Teacher schedule, try ... [Ademar](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/hor_geral.docentes_view?pv_doc_codigo=231081)
 - Subject schedule, try ... [RCOM](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/hor_geral.ucurr_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=399898)
 - Any other schedule (from sigarra, not just feup) that respects the major formats found

#### Exams Extractor
 - Exams page, try ... [MIEIC](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/exa_geral.mapa_de_exames?p_curso_id=741)
 - Any other exams page (from sigarra, not just feup) that respects the major formats found

#### Moodle Extractor
 - Hover over a moodle event on the calendar and an option to add to Google Calendar (with One click) becomes available
 - Moodle already has functionality to export events in the iCal format [here](https://moodle.up.pt/calendar/export.php)


### Exports to
[iCalendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) *.ics* format which means most applications handle it pretty well:
 - [Google Calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37118?hl=en)
 - [Apple Calendar](https://support.apple.com/guide/calendar/import-or-export-calendars-icl1023/mac)
 - IBM Lotus Notes
 - Yahoo! Calendar
 - Evolution (software)
 - eM Client
 - Lightning extension for Mozilla Thunderbird and SeaMonkey
 - [partially] by Microsoft Outlook and Novell GroupWise

## Instructions
Here's the general flow of this extension:
 1. Navigate to any Sigarra (Moodle) page with a timetable and, if it is recognized by SigToCa, a blue button (ðŸ“†) will appear next to the table
 2. Click that button and choose, from the list of detected events, the ones you want to save
 3. Click the Download button and an *.ics* file will be downloaded to your computer
 4. Go to your calendar app and upload that file to any calendar and that's it!

**OR**
 1. Same but where you see the Google Calendar button (<img src="https://github.com/msramalho/SigToCa/blob/master/icons/gcalendar.png" width="24"/>) you can click it to add that event directly to your Google Calendar on the browser.

**OR**
 1. Same but where you see the Outlook.com button (<img src="https://github.com/msramalho/SigToCa/blob/master/icons/outlook.png" width="24"/>) you can click it to add that event directly to your Outlook.com Calendar on the browser.


**Important**: This extension not only identifies the events in the page but, in the case of recurring events like classes, generates the *.ics* file in accordance to the time range specified in the page!

### Prints

### Performance
It was developed to be as non-intrusive as possible, requires no permission, only executes processes when it needs to and all the scripts are loaded after the pages are ready so as to minimize any interface performance impact!

# Contribute
You can contribute by:
 - Identifying and reporting [issues](https://github.com/msramalho/SigToCa/issues)
 - Fixing bugs - fork + branch + pull request
 - Adding more [modules/extractors](https://github.com/msramalho/SigToCa/tree/master/js/extractors) each module should address a different calendar need
 - Sharing this Extension

# Code structure
 * `extractors` for all the scripts that extract information from a page and act accordingly
 * `lib` for external scripts
 * `scripts` for the JS scripts that are atomic or that are used for an `hmtl` page
 * `utils` for functions that are reused among the `extractors` and other scripts

In the [manifest.json](manifest.json) file, in the `content_scripts` section, there is an initial match to load all the global scripts and then, for each page, each extractor is loaded.

### Extractors code
```javascript
class NewExtractor extends Extractor{
    constructor() {
        super();
        ...
        this.ready(); // this will trigger init and then attachIfPossible
    }
    //must implement: structure, attachIfPossible
    structure() { return {...} }
    attachIfPossible() {...}
    ...
}
// All the functions that are used by this script but do not
// belong to the class definition should follow the above line
...
```
The `structure()` method should return an object that describes the extractor, following this stub:
```javascript
{
    extractor: "the name of the extractor", // must be unique among extractors
    description: "a simple description of what it does",
    parameters: [{//a list of the parameters that can be used ny users
            name: "name of the parameter",
            description: "either describe or exemplify"
        }
        //... other parameters
    ],
    storage: { // the variables to save for this extractor (in the local storage)
        text: [ //variables that should be displayed and edited in <input type="text">
            {
                name: "the name of the variable, eg: title",
                default: "The default value, eg: [${acronym}] - ${room.name}"
            }
        ],
        textarea: [ //variables that should be displayed and edited in <textarea></textarea>
            {
                name: "description",
                default: "another description - can have <strong>HTML</strong> inside"
            }
        ],
        boolean: [ //variables that should be displayed and edited in <input type="checkbox">
            {
                name: "isHTML",
                default: true
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
